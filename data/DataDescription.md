# Data Description

This folder contains input files obtained from Python scripts that compute energy anomalies. A full description can be found in Strigunova et al. (2023, 2025).
There are two types of data: reanalyses and a subset of CMIP5 models (CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR) with three runs (historical, "atmosphere-only" and RCP4.5).
